<aside class="lionfacts">
  <p class="lionfactstext"> 1.) Nearly all wild lions live in Africa, below the
    Sahara Desert, but one small population exists around Gir Forest National
    Park in western India. Lions in West and Central Africa are more closely
    related to these Asiatic lions in India, than to those found in Southern
    and East Africa. <br><br> 2.) On average, males weigh 190kg (almost 30 stone)
    and females weigh 126kg (almost 20 stone). They need this weight and power
    behind them to hunt large prey and defend their pride. <br><br> 3.) Young
    lions have rosettes and spots on their sandy coats, but these generally
    disappear as they mature. <br><br> 4.) Male lion's manes grow up to 16cm
    long and are a sign of dominance. The older they get, the darker their manes
    go. As well as attracting females, their manes may also protect their neck
    and head from injuries during fights. <br><br> 5.) A pride of lions is
    usually made up of related females and their cubs, plus a male or small
    group of males who defend their pride. The lionesses rear their cubs
    together and cubs can suckle from any female with milk. </p>

<!-- The aside element essentially connects in with the css page, where I can edit
and apply aspects to that piece of text. In general, the aside element acts as
a section of content, aside from the main piece of contact which may be centred
in the page. Having the five facts sectioned to the right, aligned next to
the large imagery, is eyecatching to consumers instantly.-->
