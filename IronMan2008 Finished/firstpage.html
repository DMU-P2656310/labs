    <p class="tsdesc">Tony Stark. Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.
      Son of legendary inventor and weapons contractor Howard Stark. When Tony
      Stark is assigned to give a weapons presentation to an Iraqi unit led by
      Lt. Col. James Rhodes, he's given a ride on enemy lines. That ride ends
      badly when Stark's Humvee that he's riding in is attacked by enemy
      combatants. He survives - barely - with a chest full of shrapnel and a car
      battery attached to his heart. In order to survive he comes up with a way
      to miniaturize the battery and figures out that the battery can power
      something else. <br> Thus Iron Man is born. He uses the primitive device
      to escape from the cave in Iraq. Tony's genius mind stimulates the motion
      of him building an armored suit and upends his captors within the cave.
      Returning to America, Stark refines the suit and uses it to combat crime
      and terrorism, while being notified that the people closest to him were
      not ones to be trusted from the start. The man who was put in charge of
      Stark Industries has plans of his own to take over Tony's technology for
      other matters... <br> Feast Your Eyes On The Trailer Below! <br> </p>

<!-- The aside element essentially connects in with the css page, where I can edit
and apply aspects to that piece of text. In general, the aside element acts as
a section of content, aside from the main piece of contact which may be centred
in the page. Having the synopsis sectioned to the right, aligned opposite the
navigational links, is eyecatching to consumers instantly.-->
